To solve the problem of checking and enhancing the strength of a password, we need to determine how many characters need to be added to meet the following criteria:

    Password length is at least 6 characters.
    It contains at least one digit.
    It contains at least one lowercase English letter.
    It contains at least one uppercase English letter.
    It contains at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&*()-+.

Let's implement the function minimumNumber in C to achieve this. The function will:

    Check the presence of each required character type in the password.
    Count the number of missing types.
    Ensure the total length of the password is at least 6 characters, and calculate how many characters are needed to reach this minimum if it's not already met.

What Is the Task?

You are given two lists of integers, a and b, and you need to find out how many numbers satisfy two conditions:

    Divisibility Condition:
        Every number in the list a should be a divisor of the number we're checking.

    Factor Condition:
        The number we're checking should be a divisor of every number in the list b.

Steps to Solve the Problem

    Find Common Numbers:
        You need to find numbers that are common to both lists in terms of the conditions mentioned.

    Detailed Explanation:
        Condition 1: The number must be divisible by all the numbers in list a. For example, if a = [2, 4], then the number we are considering must be divisible by both 2 and 4.
        Condition 2: The number must be a divisor of all the numbers in list b. For example, if b = [16, 32, 96], then the number we are considering must divide each of these numbers without leaving a remainder.

Example to Illustrate

Example:

    List a: [2, 4]
    List b: [16, 32, 96]

Find Numbers Between the Lists:

    Find Numbers Divisible by All in a:
        Numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 4. These numbers can be multiples of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a.

    Check Which of These Numbers Divide All in b:
        From the list of numbers found in the first step, check which of them also divide every number in b without a remainder.

Example Calculation:

    LCM of a [2, 4]: This is 4 (the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 4).
    GCD of b [16, 32, 96]: This is 16 (the largest number that can divide all numbers in b).

Now, find multiples of 4 up to 16 and check if they divide 16, 32, and 96.

The valid numbers in this case are: 4, 8, and 16.
Task Summary

You are looking for how many numbers exist that:

    Are divisible by every number in list a.
    Divide every number in list b.

Your goal is to count such numbers

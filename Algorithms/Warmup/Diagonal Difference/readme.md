What is Asked in the Question?

The question asks you to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of a square matrix. Specifically:

    Primary Diagonal: This is the diagonal that runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix.
    Secondary Diagonal: This is the diagonal that runs from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner of the matrix.

Given a square matrix (an n×nn×n grid of integers), the task is to:

    Calculate the sum of the elements on the primary diagonal.
    Calculate the sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal.
    Compute the absolute difference between these two sums.

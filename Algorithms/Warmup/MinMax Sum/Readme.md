Explanation of the Problem

The problem requires calculating the minimum and maximum sums of exactly four out of five given positive integers. You need to print the minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated integers.
Example

For the array arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], we can derive the following:

    The sum of the smallest four numbers: 1+3+5+7=161+3+5+7=16
    The sum of the largest four numbers: 3+5+7+9=243+5+7+9=24

The function should print: 16 24
